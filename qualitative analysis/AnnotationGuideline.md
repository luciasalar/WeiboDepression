## Task 2: Annotate rumination in the post

Rumination is repetitively going over a thought or a problem without completion. The valence of these thoughts are usually negative, but they can be neutral or positive as well. The ruminating behaviour on Weibo should be the act of posting multiple Weibo that show deep thoughts or reflection about the same topic. Therefore, ruminating Weibo often comes in a series.

For example:

1. 可能你很久以后才学会爱人，我很遗憾只做了你途中の风景
2. 有时候会想，为什么偏偏是天籁。以后每次坐他的车，都难以忘记第一次你用挂挡の那只手牵着我，跟我说手动挡都无所谓，何况这是自动挡。真的希望回忆不能欺骗时光太久，愿无岁月可回首，愿无深情共白头。
3. 隐藏了关于你的一切，不后悔曾经爱过你，也没力气再向前。如果我的心痛全世界没有一个人懂，我也不后悔曾经爱过。
